Instructions to modify an Ender-3 3D printer to print from raw pellets

This pellet printing modification is designed to be open source, available to hobbyists for purchase and install. The pellet printer is able to bypass the manufacturing costs associated with filament printing, use flexible materials normally unsuitable for filament printing, and allow users to mix pellets for their own blends of printed material.

## Team
These fine Valparaiso University students worked for nine months to make this project happen:  [Blake Andrew](mailto:blake.andrew@valpo.edu), [Daniel Heinrich](mailto:daniel.heinrich@valpo.edu), [Mikey Pinchok](mailto:mikey.pinchok@valpo.edu), [Kay Shoolian](mailto:kay.shoolian@valpo.edu), [Ethan Storer](mailto:ethan.storer@valpo.edu), and [Timothy Ziemann](mailto:timothy.ziemann@valpo.edu).  Their team name was the "Vinyl Velocirapters."

Vidette Makes' [Adam Johnson](mailto:ajohnson@videttemakes.org) proposed the project and served as the team's "customer."
