Instructions to modify an Ender-3 3D printer to print from raw pellets

This pellet printing modification is designed to be open source, available to hobbyists for purchase and install. The pellet printer is able to bypass the manufacturing costs associated with filament printing, use flexible materials normally unsuitable for filament printing, and allow users to mix pellets for their own blends of printed material.
